### Font

You may have noticed that the font does not match the original one. To solve this issue, you need to [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and install fonts from the official JetBrains website.

Also, after choosing a theme, follow the path:

**Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors**.

In the Font field, select one of the JetBrains fonts (I highly recommend JetBrains Mono)

## How can I help?

If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.


## Conclusion

Initially, I did this theme extension for myself and as an experiment and did not really count on any result, but now I hope that I have enough time and energy to support and develop it.

Thank you for installing and have a nice day!
