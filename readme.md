*Hiberbee Theme is a Visual Studio (2022) extension with 3 dark themes & 1 light*
- `Hiberbee (Legacy)` - the original jetbrains-version colors
- `Hiberbee Dark` - my improvements (colored extensions methods, enum values etc)
- `Hiberbee Light` - light version

Vivid, color-intensive dark theme for Visual Studio IDE with consolidated color code for all programming languages.
Features:
Unique color identity map for all language elements and constructs
Design is available and maintained in Figma [template](https://www.figma.com/file/2oyhOnKUdLZCDQEkH2klNT/Hiberbee-Theme) color palette

## Download Latest Version
The latest stable version can be downloaded from the VisualStudio [marketplace][marketplace] page.

## How To Use
It's very simple:
 - Download the latest version of extension from Visual Studio marketplace (.vsix file).
 - Install the extension for your Visual Studio 2022.
 - Follow: **Tools > Theme > Hiberbee**.
 - Enjoy

That's it, the installation is complete!

## Color Scheme

## Font
You may have noticed that the font does not match the original one. To solve this issue, you need to [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and install fonts from the official JetBrains website.

Also, after choosing a theme, follow the path:

**Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors**.

In the Font field, select one of the JetBrains fonts (I highly recommend JetBrains Mono)

## How can I help?
**If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].**

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.


## Conclusion
Initially, I did this theme extension for myself and as an experiment and did not really count on any result, but now I hope that I have enough time and energy to support and develop it.

Thank you for installing and have a nice day!
