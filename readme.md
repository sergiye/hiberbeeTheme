### Font

You may have noticed that the font does not match the original one. To solve this issue, you need to [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and install fonts from the official JetBrains website.

Also, after choosing a theme, follow the path:

**Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors**.

In the Font field, select one of the JetBrains fonts (I highly recommend JetBrains Mono)
